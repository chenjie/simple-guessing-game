# simple-guessing-game
This program uses two processes in total. Parent process tries to guess a user-specified integer number between 0 and 1023 (inclusive). The child process interacts with the user via stdin and stdout. When user receives a guess from the parent process, then he/she should enter either "hi" or "lo", depending on if the parent's guess is either too high or too low, respectively.
